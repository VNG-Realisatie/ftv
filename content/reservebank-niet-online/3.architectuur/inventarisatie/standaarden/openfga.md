## Fragmenten
- OpenFGA is a high performance and flexible authorization/permission system built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar.
- Relationship-based access control made fast, scalable, and easy to use.
- OpenFGA is an open-source authorization solution that allows developers to build granular access control using an easy-to-read modeling language and friendly APIs.
- OpenFGA takes the best ideas from Google's Zanzibar paper for Relationship-Based Access Control, and also solves problems for Role-based Access Control and Attribute-Based Access Control use cases. The modeling language is powerful enough for engineers, but friendly enough for other stakeholders on your team as well.
- Transparency and peer review are important for building secure, stable, and sustainable software. OpenFGA's RFC process and governance model invite anyone to become a contributor, and collaboratively develop the public roadmap. Come create the next standard for authorization with us!
