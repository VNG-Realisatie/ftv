# Architecture Decision Record[^1]

> Architecture for agile projects has to be described and defined differently.
> Not all decisions will be made at once, nor will all of them be done when the project begins.
> 
> An architecture decision record is a short text file in a format similar to an Alexandrian pattern.
> (Though the decisions themselves are not necessarily patterns, they share the characteristic balancing of forces.)
> Each record describes a set of forces and a single decision in response to those forces. Note that the decision is the central piece here,
> so specific forces may appear in multiple ADRs.

## Definitie voor FTV

We zullen in dit project (net als FSC[^2]) gebruik maken van ADR om onze architectuur beslissingen te verzamelen en vast te leggen.

De ADR-records zijn in de Gitlab repository[^3] te vinden.
