## Fragementen
- Ideally, a policy-based management system should facilitate the definition of high-level administrative goals, which are easy for humans to express and understand, enable their translation into low-level policies and map them into commands that configure the managed devices accordingly. While the high-level goals reflect the business objectives of the network administrator, the low-level policies are responsible for device-level configurations.
