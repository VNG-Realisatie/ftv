## Fragmenten
- Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
-  In the physical world, a credential might consist of:
   - Information related to identifying the subject of the credential (for example, a photo, name, or identification number)
   - Information related to the issuing authority (for example, a city government, national agency, or certification body)
   - Information related to the type of credential this is (for example, a Dutch passport, an American driving license, or a health insurance card)
   - Information related to specific attributes or properties being asserted by the issuing authority about the subject (for example, nationality, the classes of vehicle entitled to drive, or date of birth)
   - Evidence related to how the credential was derived
   - Information related to constraints on the credential (for example, expiration date, or terms of use).
- A verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents. The addition of technologies, such as digital signatures, makes verifiable credentials more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts.
- Holders of verifiable credentials can generate verifiable presentations and then share these verifiable presentations with verifiers to prove they possess verifiable credentials with certain characteristics.
- Both verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations can be transmitted rapidly, making them more convenient than their physical counterparts when trying to establish trust at a distance.

## Observaties
- ontworpen voor identificatie, het bewaren van claims in persoonlijke digitale wallets, en de mogelijkheid om die c=laims te verifieren.
- in de EU gebaseerd op blockchain technologie (EBSI).
