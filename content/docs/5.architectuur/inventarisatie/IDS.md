## Fragmenten
- As a non-profit organization, the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) is dedicated to creating standards for data spaces. These standards are designed to ensure secure data sharing between participants within a specified governance framework, fostering trust and maintaining data sovereignty.
- Data Usage Control in the IDS basically works by attaching data usage policy information to data being exchanged and continuously controlling the way data is processed, aggregated, or forwarded to other endpoints. This data-centric perspective allows Data Providers to continuously control data flows, rather than accesses to services. At configuration time, data usage policies support developers and administrators in setting up correct data flows.
