# Building blocks

The design is (in part) based on the principle of trust between the organizations that exchange data.

## Trust network
The basic building block for the connection between organizations exchanging data, using PKI Overheid certificates.

This can be based on the Digikoppleing REST API standard or on the newer FSC standard.
